* trying some example via crime data through ggmap, always failed at get_map, not sure what happened. For this assignment, have no idea how to do it well. but it looks fancy with map. 

* checked some leaflet example online [here](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/showhide.html)

* the truth is for now it is hard to come up with fancy plot, it is rearly use in my daily life, so it is hard to interprete a good ploto except simple things like call a city name and show the map.


* summary of learning: I realized spatial data is useful for earth science, environment science study. Anything related to location will be useful to interprete with spatial data. I never use data with lag and long, so it is hard to learn and apply immediately. But it is nice way to show more information with location specified data.
